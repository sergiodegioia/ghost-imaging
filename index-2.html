    <h1>Ghost Imaging</h1>
    <div>Ghost imaging is a non-conventional way to form images of objects without ever taking pictures of them. </div>
<div>In conventional imaging to take the picture of an object, the object must be illuminated and the optical instrument that takes the picture (like a camera, or a microscope) has its sensor invested by the light that illuminates the object after it has hit the object. </div>
<p>Even in ghost imaging, the object still needs to be illuminated, but the camera does <em>not</em> look at the object. Instead, it records the light <em>before</em> it reaches the object.</p>
<p>To do that, the camera is shifted sideways and we insert a <strong>beam splitter</strong>: an optical component that splits a light beam into two paths. One path continues straight to the object; the other is reflected toward the camera, so the object is no longer in the camera’s field of view.</p>
<p>If we simply took a picture this way, we would only see the background. The “ghost” trick is to use an additional signal to reconstruct the object anyway — we’ll see how in a moment.</p>
<p>With that clever arrangement, the object appears faintly in the reconstructed image, hence the name “ghost imaging”. The method is useful when the object cannot be directly imaged, or when it would be damaged by the wavelengths your camera can detect (in that case, the split can be done by wavelength, sending only “safe” components to the object and the remaining ones to the camera).</p>
<p>A key limitation is that ghost imaging is a <strong>multi-shot</strong> technique: it requires many acquisitions, so the object must remain still long enough.</p>
<p>The extra piece of information comes from a very simple detector placed after the object. Unlike a camera sensor made of many pixels, this detector has no spatial resolution: it only tells us whether light arrived (“bright”) or not (“dark”).</p>
<p>The camera, sitting on the reference path, records many frames of the reference light. If we sum all frames, the object disappears (because the camera never sees it). But if we keep only the frames for which the detector behind the object registered light, and discard the others, the transparent part of the object gradually emerges.</p>
<p>Why does this selection work? It becomes clearer in the quantum version, where correlations are explicit. Before that, let’s recall how a normal photo forms if we think of light as photons.</p>
<p>To unveil the secret of its working it is simpler to examine the quantum version of the ghost imaging technique, which makes use of a special light for illumination, but before that quantum nature of light must be understood as a stream of photons.</p>

        </h1>
<p class="lead my-4">To see how a photo forms, imagine light as a stream of photons and an object that is partly transparent and partly opaque.</p>
<p class="text-muted">The animation helps following the reasoning. </p>

<p>To make the process visible, the animation shows photons moving slowly (in reality they travel at the speed of light). For simplicity, we also assume the source is so weak that photons are emitted one at a time.</p>
<p>In the animation photons are represented as small balls which run along straight lines from the light source.</p>
<p>Every time a photon encounters the object in a transmissive region it proceeds undisturbed eventually reaching the sensor in a given pixel and the camera in the progress of taking the picture remember that that pixel has been hit by a photon (in the animation that memo is represented by the lightening of the hit pixel).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a photon meets the object in an opaque region it is destroyed (represented in the animation by the disappearing of the ball) and no effect is recorded by the camera.</p>
<p>Since photons come out of the light source choosing a direction which is completely random among all the possibilities, as time progresses all the possible directions will be taken by at least a photon, in such a way that all the point of the object will be illuminated. There follows that all and only the pixels on the sensor that happen to be on a straight line passing throught the light source without intersecting the object in its opaque region are illuminated and thus taken all together repoduce the shape of the object with its transparent and opaque regions.</p>

  You can see three elements: at the bottom the light source (a star), in the middle a transmissive object with an S-shaped “window”, and at the top the camera sensor.

  Note: the sensor is drawn with only 32 pixels to make the accumulation of photons easy to see, so the S edge looks “stair-stepped”. The lens is not shown in the animation, but in a real camera it sits between object and sensor and is what forms the image.

        <p class="lead my-4">Now let’s return to quantum ghost imaging. The illumination is “special” because it consists of photon pairs created together and correlated: by detecting one photon we gain information about its partner (often described as entanglement).</p>
<p class="text-muted">The pairs are produced by sending a laser through a nonlinear crystal, which can make one laser photon <strong>split</strong> into two lower-energy photons whose total energy matches the original. The two photons emerge in correlated directions: one goes toward the object and a simple detector behind it; the other goes toward the camera on the reference arm.</p>
<p>The camera records many frames, ideally one per pair. Each frame contains at most a single hit on one pixel (from the reference photon). If we sum <em>all</em> frames, we get a uniform image and the object does not appear, because it is never in the camera’s field of view.</p>
<p>The image appears when we keep only the frames that are in <strong>coincidence</strong>: those for which the detector behind the object also clicked (meaning the other photon passed through a transparent region). Summing only these selected frames reveals the transparent part of the object.</p>

  At the bottom there is the source (a laser), and just above it a nonlinear crystal that generates correlated photon pairs. One photon goes to the object (left) and then to a simple detector with no spatial resolution; the other goes to the camera (right), which records the hit pixel.

        <p class="lead my-4">Even though the internal workings of ghost imaging has been explained only for the quantum version of it, which encompass the use of a laser as a source of light to illuminate the object, the sama strategy can be applied using "normal" light.</p>
<p class="text-muted">The main change needed for it to work is the substitution of the triggering action of the photo-sensor on the camera sensor with correlation computation between the intensities caputured by the camera sensor and the photo-sensor at each picture taken by the camera and the discarding those pictures with low correlation.</p>
